    "# Nested Loop & conditional statements: Read the content of a file and count the frequency of letters appeared in the text file.\n",
    "1. It reads the content (passage) of file (.txt).\n",
    "2. The programm will count the frequency of the letters in the passages. How many times a letter appears in the text. And print the letter with maximum and minimum number of appearance in the text file.\n",
    "3. The counting will be stored in the dictionary for every letters in english alphabets.\n",
    "4. Guidlines: \n",
    "       i. This code ignore: spaces, numbers, special characters in the text file.\n",
    "       ii. The uppercase and lowercase number considered to be equal while counting the letters. The dictionary will prepared in lowercase.\n",
    "       \n",
    "Standard functions:\n",
    "1. split(): This function returns the list of individual words from the given line/phrsae/passage. \n",
    "    example 1: \"Beautiful program\".split() - It returns ['Beautiful', 'program']. => It will split at space between words\n",
    "    example 2: \"Beautiful, program\".split(\",\") - It returns ['Beautiful', 'program']. => It will split at coma between words\n",
    "2. .isalpha() : In the sentences there are characters, spaces, numbers and special characters. This function checks whether the charatcter (or string of length 1) is alphabetical or not. Returns True if alphabets, otherwise False. example: \"a\".isalpha() -> True. \"@\".isalpha() ->  False.\n",
    "3. .lower() : it converts the whole string into the lowercase. Example- \"PyThon\".lower()-> 'python'\n",
    "4. pprint() -> pretty-print. It prints the data structure in an user friendly format. It will print the dictionary vertically instead horizontal. Its just for better visualization purpose.\n",
    "    install: import pprint\n",
    "       \n",
    "Execution Instruction:\n",
    "1. Place your own text file in the same folder where your jupyter ot python is present. Or paste your content in the text file available on my github. or just run by default. The exacat name of the text file must be named in jupyter/python file.\n"
